Node.js
===


### What is Node.js? 
Node JS is a runtime enviornment that executes Javascript on a server or your laptop instead of in the browser. If you're coming from C++ or C, it can be thought of as both a compiler and an execution enviornment. When you might have run `gcc mycode.cpp` and `./a.out`, Node simply requires running node and passing in a target file: `node index.js`.
